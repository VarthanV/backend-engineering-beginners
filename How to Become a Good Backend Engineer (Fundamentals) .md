### Communication Protocols

- Study about TCP and UDP
- TCP VS UDP
- Why TCP is slow.
- Since we understand the why we make better decisions.
- How HTTP works ?
- It is critical to understand as backend engineer.
- It helps us to answer questions like why an API is slow and what is happening to the TCP connection.
- About HTTP1 , HTTP2 , HTTP3
- Websockets when to use , Bidirectional communication
- gRPC.
- We can write our own **Request for Comments** (RFC) if we understand these concepts.

### Web servers

- They are more critical to the backend systems.
- They communicate with HTTP.
- Their job is to serve content
- The content can be both static and dynamic
- Concepts like single threaded (NodeJS) or multi threaded(Apache)

### Database engineering

- It is very deep and high level.
- It is a niche field.
- ACID properties.
- Database isolation.
- Relation databases.
- NOSQL
- We move to NOSQL and give lineancy for ACID properties

 

### Proxies

- Proxy
- Reverse Proxy
- Caching
- Load balancers
- TLS termination
- Layer 3 , Layer 4 ,Layer 7 proxying
- Service meshes (Proxy and reverse proxy)
- Caching is very critical for serving content fast
- Stateful VS stateless caching.
- Cache eviction is important problem in CS

### Messaging systems

- Messaging systems are very important for asynchornous communication (RabbitMQ , Redis)
- Kafka is a pub-sub system

### Frameworks

- NodeJS
- Django
- <Insert framework>
- It is very closer to webserver but framework serves dynamic content

### Message Formats

- XML
- JSON
- Protocol Buffers (Resolved to send high bandwidth messages)

### Security

- TLS
- Encryption / Decryption.
- Communicate between nodes.
- Save your DB credentials secure
- Firewall (Which port to open)
- DDOS.
- Prevent attacks
- Web security
- Network Security

### Post session

- Languages doesnâ€™t matter , Just learn the core concepts and apply the concepts in code
- Try JS or python  , Dont go with jargons.
- Any fundamental can be applied with any language
