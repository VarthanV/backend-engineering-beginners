# backend-engineering-beginners

I recently decided to learn about Backend engineering from  the Backend Engineering videos of  ********************************Hussein Nasser (********************************[https://twitter.com/hnasr](https://twitter.com/hnasr)****************)   .****************  I decided to take short notes for each of the videos.Hussein has 3 playlists for Backend Engineering. This page contains short notes for each of the video. The sub pages title will be same as the title of the video.
